One idea that kept standing out in different forms in the books and the therapy
sessions was this idea of mindfulness. It was presented in many 
different ways: prayer, meditation, 'being with' my emotions, being still. I
quickly figured out that in the darkest moments of depression, just simply
whispering to myself "I'm sad" made me feel a tiny bit better. When I was
having a panic attack, just being still and whispering to myself "I'm scared",
was soothing. 

I was very curious about this, the engineer within me wanted to
explore it. It's a funny thing, I was practicing mindfulness and didn't know it.
Researching this lead me to read more about mindfulness, judgement, attachment, love, compassion, and empathy. 
Somewhere among the TED talks, the books, the Reddit discussions, these 
concepts kept coming up associated with Buddhism. I
had always believed that Buddhism was just another religion where they worshipped
Buddha. But as I explored I began to see that there's truths that I,
a Christian, can learn from Buddhism. And so I explored some more. 

I quickly figured out that Buddhism isn't about worshipping Buddha at all,
Buddha was a teacher, no more, no less, and there have been more than one
Buddha. Buddhism doesn't have a deity, or an
explanation of how the world was created. Buddhism is more about a
compassionate way of living than it is a religion of worship. I liked what I
was learning.

I was already growing uncomfortable with labels, especially the Christian
label. In today's culture, being labeled as a Christian draws out
negative bias in many people. I wanted to love and show compassion. But
you can't exactly walk up to a gay person and say "Hi I'm a Christian" and
expect them to be open and at ease. _Once you label me, you negate me_ Widely
attributed to Kierkegaard, but apparently not a quote by him. Regardless of
it's source, I think this is
true in many cases. I may be labeled as "lost" by some of my Christian brothers and sisters, because I'm
exploring Buddhism. Another label, and possibly being dismissed and unable to
reach out and connect and share truth and love. The Dalai Lama himself is
widely quoted as saying something to the effect of _Don't use Buddhism to
become a better Buddhist, use Buddhism to become a better whatever you already
are_. I love this, it's cuts off the label and gets to the core of what
Buddhism stands for. Labels are just another form of judgement.

I've always felt that one's salvation
is a very personal thing. I've never understood why some Christians are overly concerned
with other's salvation. It's judgement, and it gets in the way of loving. If I think your
lifestyle has put you on the path to hell and I'm going to try to influence you
back on the path to heaven, I've judged you. I'd rather not be concerned with
yours or my own salvation, your choices are yours to make and who am I to tell
you they are right or wrong? Am I interpreting the Bible correctly or are you?
I'd rather put the right and wrong aside, leave judgement out of it. Suffering
is a fact of life, and I'd rather help meet people's needs here and now than
try to save them from hell. If I can't meet their needs, then I want to be
empathetic so they don't suffer alone.  This is the Buddhist way of life. This
is what attracts me most to Buddhism.

All of this applies to how I treat myself too. An excellent book on this
concept is "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz. How I treat others is a
direct reflection of how I treat myself. So all of these Buddhist principles apply to how you treat yourself.
Don't judge yourself so harshly. Forgive yourself. Practice self compassion. It
releases me from shame and makes me feel happier about where I am.
