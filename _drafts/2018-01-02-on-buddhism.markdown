One idea that kept standing out in different forms in the books and the therapy
sessions was this idea of mindfulness. It was presented in many 
different ways: prayer, meditation, 'being with' my emotions, being still. I
quickly figured out that in the darkest moments of depression, just simply
whispering to myself "I'm sad" made me feel a tiny bit better. When I was
having a panic attack, just being still and whispering to myself "I'm scared",
was soothing. I was very curious about this, being an engineer, I wanted to
explore it more. I was practicing mindfulness and didn't know it.
I read more about mindfulness, judgement, attachment, love, compassion, and empathy. 
Somewhere among the TED talks, the books, the Reddit discussions, these 
concepts kept coming up associated with Buddhism. I
had always believed that Buddhism was just another religion and they worshipped
Buddha. But I thought maybe there's something I can learn from Buddhism, and
still be a Christian? So I did some exploring. 

I quickly figured out that Buddhism isn't about worshipping Buddha at all,
Buddha was a teacher, no more, no less, and there have been more than one
Buddha. Buddhism doesn't have a deity, or an
explanation of how the world was created. Buddhism is more about a
compassionate way of living than it is a religion of worship. I liked what I
was learning, and so I explored more.
