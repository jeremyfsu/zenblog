Just months before my marriage ended, I had ticked off an item on my bucket
list. I had loaded the kids in an RV and driven cross country, from Louisville, KY all the way to the
Pacific Ocean and back.  It was epic, with stops at Yellowstone, Grand Teton,
Olympic National Park, and more. My wife and I survived 2 months in a 23 foot RV
with 3 kids, I thought we were bullet proof.

Barely 2 months later, she decides to end the marriage of 14 years. I was
blindsided.  Just 2 years before we had moved to Louisville, I worked from
home, had no friends, my whole life was my wife and my kids.

Initially I leaned on my Christian faith, but even that was unsteady and
fractured. After telling me for 14 years that divorce was not an option,
suddenly she's telling me that she has justification from God to divorce me.
Yet I'm believing that God was telling me something different.  How can two
people hear two different things from the same God?

Even before this event in my life, I was growing uncomfortable with all the
judgement I was observing among people. I was uncomfortable with so many
passages in the Bible being interpreted in different ways, and people judging
others based on this.  I observed people considering the Bible in very black and white terms, yet it all seems to
be hundreds of shades of grey to me. How can people choose seemingly
arbitrary shades of gray, call their version black and white, then judge
everyone else as bad or good based against it?

After some marriage counseling, I figured out that her reality was radically
different from my own, right down to things we did and said in the past. How can we have
such firm beliefs in two radically different realities and events? I literally
thought I was going crazy and even began to question my own memory and sanity.

Everything was a blur for about 9 months as I flailed about trying to make
sense of it all. As I struggled in a yo-yo cycle of anxiety and depression, I
read tons of books, both secular and Christian. I tried real hard to find
meaning in everything that was happening.

I had nothing left, no faith, no religion, no life partner, my kids were almost the
only thing that gave me purpose to continue living. I had read a book titled "The Art of
Possibility" a few years before, and although it's message didn't sink in fully
until later, it did open my mind to all the possibility that lay before me.
Here I was, with most of what I held dear gone, but like a garden plot in the
winter, the barren dirt has so much possibility come spring.
And it is here, that I found a new path to take.
