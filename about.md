I was living a totally mindless life. My emotions were in control of my
behavior, not me. The simple concept that we don't control what happens to us,
but we do control how we react, was foreign to me.

After a traumatic divorce I set out on a path of self discovery and learned
that I didn't have to live so mindlessly.

This blog is a collection of thoughts and realizations I've come to along this
path.
